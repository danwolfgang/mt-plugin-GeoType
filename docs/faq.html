<h6>Why can't I see a map...
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li>
			<a name="edit_entry"></a>
			<h6>in my Edit Entry screen?</h6>
			<ol class="nobullet">
				<li><p>If you can't see any areas that would display GeoType data on your Edit Entry Screen
					and you see the message 'To Enable GeoType, add the appropriate library mapping keys in your
					settings', <a href="blog_key.html">set up this blog's GoogleMaps API key</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>If you are able to see the areas where GeoType data should appear (such as the
					extra fields for the location's name and address) but the map <i>itself</i> is not
					displaying, the GoogleMaps API key for this blog may be incorrect for the 
					Movable Type installation.  <a href="system_wide.html">Create a new system-wide key</a>
					to fix it.  Note: This should not affect the key used in any of your published pages.</li>

<a name="promo"></a>
<h6>What is the difference between the Promo Images (Thumbnail, Large Promo, Billboard Image or Flash, Optional Promo)
	and the photos I can see in the Entry Photo?</h6>
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li>The "Promo Images" are the photos displayed on the <a href="http://www.radaronline.com" target="_blank">Radar Homepage</a>, 
		on a blog's main page (like on <a href="http://www.radaronline.com/features" target="_blank">Features</a>), and in the search
		results page.  The Entry Photos are the ones that are displayed within the built archive pages <b>only</b>.</li>
	</ul>

<br />
<a name="otherblog"></a>
	<h6>Why can't I see a photo preview for a photo I know I've uploaded and spelled correctly?</h6>
	
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li>Your photo must have been uploaded through the <b>current</b> blog in order to view the 
			preview and have the MTPhoto tag make the correct image link.  Try uploading the photo again
			to the blog you're working in.  
		</li>
		<li>
			If that doesn't work, you can always check if the photo was uploaded into your blog properly by 
			checking through your internet browser.  Go to the main page of your blog on the staging server
			(<a href="http://staging.radaronline.com/features/">Features</a>, 
			<a href="http://staging.radaronline.com/exclusives/">Fresh Intelligence</a>, etc) and type your
			file's name <b>directly after the slash of the web address</b>.  If the picture is there, it should
			show only the image in the web browser without any fancy stylings.  If the picture is missing, a webpage
			with text like "The requested page could not be found".  
		</li>
	</ul>
	

<br />
<a name="nocaption"></a>
	<h6>What if my photo doesn't have a caption?</h6>
	
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li>Then your photo won't have the caption text displayed.  The photo itself will still display on 
			the page.</li>
	</ul>
	
<br />
<a name="sizing"></a>
	<h6>How can I tell if the photo I've uploaded is large or small?</h6>
	
	<ul class="nobullet">
		<li>If you've associated it with an entry, then in the entry's Photo Listing, the photo <b>Style</b>
			field (<a href="photo_add.html">Adding Photos, Figure 4i)</a>) should state if it's a small or
			large image.  The cutoff to determine an image's sizing is also displayed on the entry's Photo Listing
			page at the top in red (<a href="photo_add.html">Adding Photos, Figure 4c</a>).
		</li>
