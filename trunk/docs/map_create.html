<h1>Creating Locations and GoogleMaps in an Entry</h1>

<p>GeoType allows you to note several points as Locations to appear on one GoogleMap that will be
	placed directly onto your entry's published page.  
	<br />
	<br />
	When you create a new location from scratch in an entry, that location's data is saved and can be
	re-used throughout the blog on any entry.  It is also possible to save 
	<a href="more_fields.html">more data</a> about the location.  Map appearance settings are
	<b>not</b> saved along with the location; that is to say if you zoom in very closely in one entry with
	the location "Iceland", on another entry you can independently zoom out or choose another map type
	without affecting the first entry.

	<br />
	<br />
	This page explains how to:

<h5>Create Your First Location From Scratch</h5>

	<ol class="numbers">
		<li>Click "Add Location..."  <span class="figure-ref">[ Figure 1 ]</span>
			<br /><br />
		</li>
		
		<li>Enter a name for your location.  It can be anything specific or generic, but it is required.
			<br /><br />
		</li>

		<li>Enter the address for your location.  Your address will be fed into the GoogleMaps engine, so 
			any address that would be accepted by GoogleMaps can be accepted here.  Note that in
			<span class="figure-ref">[ Figure 2 ]</span> the address is just "Iceland", but that's good
			enough for GoogleMaps to determine which point to plot on the map.
			<br /><br />	
		</li>
		
		<li>Click the 'Geocode' link across from the Name and Address fields.
			<br /><br />
		</li>

		<li>If the address could be mapped, the Latitude and Longitude values will be displayed underneath
			the Address field and your new map should appear in the preview box with the point
			marked with a red thumbtack bubble <span class="figure-ref"> [ Figure 3 ]</span>.
			<br />
			<br />
			If the map cannot be pinpointed by Google, a message box will pop up in your Internet
			Browser with an error message. <span class="figure-ref">[ Figure 4 ]</span>  Check with the
			<a href="faq.html#error_msg">FAQ</a> for a complete listing of error messages and what
			they mean.
			<br /><br />
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Save</b> the entry.  You cannot save the created location's coordinates unless you save the 
			entry.
			<br /><br />
		</li>
	</ol>
	
<a name="saved_locations"></a>
<h5>Add a Saved Location</h5>

	<ol class="numbers">
		<li>From your Edit Entry screen, click "Add Location..." <span class="figure-ref">[ Figure 1 ]</span>
			<br /><br />	
		</li>
		
		<li>View the "Saved Locations" dropdown menu choices and select the one you'd like to use. 
			<span class="figure-ref">[ Figure 5 ]</span>
			<br /><br />
		</li>
		
		<li>The preview map should add that location as a point, and the Name, Address, and Lat/Long fields
			should fill in that location's data automatically.
			<br /><br />
		</li>
		
		<li><b>Save</b> the entry to save the location in the entry.
			<br /><br />
		</li>
	</ol>	
	
<a name="more_locations"></a>
<h5>Add More Locations</h5>
<p>Because only one map is shown per published entry, multiple locations are marked with the red thumbtack
	bubble on the same map.  To add more locations, simply follow the steps above to either create a location 
	<a href="#from_scratch">from scratch</a> or <a href="#saved_locations">from a saved location</a>. Note that
	the entry's preview map will display the new location's thumbtack upon location creation, but after you save
	the entry, you can control the zoom to contain all of the locations.
	
</p>
	
<br />
<a name="appearance"></a>
<h5>Configuring Your Map's Appearance</h5>
<p>All of the controls you view on the map of your Edit Entry screen are the ones that will appear on
	the entry's published page.  If you'd like the map to be of a certain type or centered in an alternate
	place, <b>make the preview map look how you'd like it to appear</b> and save the entry.  The zoom 
	settings, center point, and map type will all appear on the published page as you choose while
	editing the entry.
	<br />
	<br />
	If there are options you'd like to change but are not able to, the settings may have been disabled
	for this blog.  View the <a href="map_settings.html">Map Settings</a> page for more information.
